Current Salary Cap Situation:
1. Committed Contracts:
   - Tennessee Titans have several key player contracts extending into the future, impacting their salary cap allocations.
   - Calvin Ridley's 4-year, $92M contract with an annual average salary of $23M significantly affects the cap.
   - Other contracts include core players' salaries, bonuses, and guaranteed money.

2. Dead Money:
   - Dead money results from previous contracts having incurred cap hits without the players being on the current roster.
   - Titans' current dead money totals must be evaluated to project its effect on future cap space.

3. Projected Cap Space (Next 4 Years):
   - 2025: Tennessee expects a modest increase in cap demands as player contracts escalate.
   - 2026: Cap space might be constrained due to tier 1 payments for seasoned players and retention deals.
   - 2027: A release of certain player contracts might provide more breathing room in cap space.
   - 2028: Projections suggest a strategic period for renovating contracts and balancing veteran retention with rookie influx.

Wide Receiver Acquisition Strategy:
1. Performance Metrics Evaluation:
   - The targeted WR averaged substantial seasonal receptions and showed consistent yardage gains and touchdowns.
   - Market Comparisons suggest that a new contract should align between $20M-$30M annually, considering market flexibility similar to Tyreek Hill's recent deal.

2. Contract Structure Scenario:
   - Scenario 1: A 4-year, $100M contract for the WR, with $25M average annual salary, aligns with emerging trends for high-performing receivers.
   - Scenario 2: A 3-year, $82.5M contract with front-loaded guarantees could better fit Titans' immediate cap constraints.
   - Scenario 3: A back-loaded contract providing higher payouts in later years when current cap tension eases.

3. Potential Restructuring Opportunities:
   - Calvin Ridley's contract provides room for bonuses restructuring to ease immediate cap load.
   - Negotiating pay cuts or moving guaranteed money to performance incentives for aging players can provide cap relief.
   - Exploring trade opportunities for underperforming high-salary players to eliminate cap strain.
