#### Contract Recommendation:
- **Conservative Scenario:** 3-year, $75M, 40% guarantees with performance incentives. 
- **Moderate Scenario (Recommended):** 4-year, $100M, 45% guarantees with additional performance and playoff incentives. 
- **Aggressive Scenario:** 5-year, $130M, 50% guarantees, including high-performance incentives.

#### Rationale:
- **Performance Metrics:** The client's performance consistently exceeds league averages, alongside recognitions such as Pro Bowl selections.
- **Market Comparison:** Contracts of similar tier WRs (e.g., DeVonta Smith at $75M, Calvin Ridley at $92M) support the proposed salary range.

2. **Timeline:**
   - **Week 1-2:** Begin preliminary negotiations, focusing on moderate scenario as groundwork.
   - **Week 3:** Assess counteroffers and leverage additional incentives for playoffs.
   - **Week 4:** Finalize terms and confirm guarantees, exploring contract bonuses adjustments if needed.
3. **Draft Announcement Drafting:** Develop communication strategy for a public press release across Eagles’ platforms post-agreement.

#### Stakeholder Communication Strategy:

2. **Player Representation Meeting:** Continuous updates to the player and their financial team addressing progress and adjustments.
3. **Public Announcement:** Collaborate with Eagles' media relations department to draft a press announcement, including community engagement narratives.
