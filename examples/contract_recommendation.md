- **Total Value:** $265M–$270M
    - **Annual Average Value (AAV):** $53M–$54M
    - **Signing Bonus:** $55M–$60M; paid upon execution, prorated over contract for cap
- **Total Guarantees:** $185M–$200M
    - **Full Guarantees at Signing:** $140M–$150M (combination signing bonus, 2024–2025 base, 2025 roster/option)
    - **Rolling Guarantees:** Subsequent year base salaries and roster/option bonuses vest annually each March on roster date (protection against late releases)
    - **Injury Protection:** 3 years fully guaranteed for injury/skill/cap; Years 4–5 vest as practical (upon being on roster)
- **Base Salaries:**
    - 2024: $2M (cap friendly)
    - 2025: $38M–$40M
    - 2026: $42M–$45M
    - 2027: $45M
    - 2028: $45M (voidable for team opt-out post-2027)
- **Roster/Option Bonuses:** $4M–$6M annually, vest as guaranteed if player on roster preceding March 1 each year
- **Incentives/Escalators:**
    - **Statistical:** Up to $3M/yr for 4,250/4,500/5,000 passing yards; 40+ TDs; high TD:INT ratio
    - **Playoff/Team Success:** Up to $5M/yr for playoff berths, playoff wins, AFC championship, Super Bowl appearance/win
    - **Honors:** $1M–$1.5M/yr for Pro Bowl, All-Pro, AFC Offensive Player of Year
    - **Rushing:** $300K–$1M/yr for 250–450+ rush yards
- **Protective Clauses:**
    - **Full No-Trade Clause:** Through at least Year 4; player approval required for any trade
    - **No Franchise/Transition Tag:** Player cannot be tagged upon expiry; protects free agency/renegotiation rights
    - **Offset Language:** Only traditional for skill/cap situation; if injury, full guarantee vests with no offset
    - **Player Opt-Out:** If less than 50% of practical guarantees vest by end of Year 2; also, player option to void final year if wishing to renegotiate
    - **Workout Bonus:** $500K annually; allowances for family commitments
    - **Offseason Medical Protection:** Team funds all needed offsite training/rehab, regardless of provider/location

- **Cap Hits (Estimated):**
    - 2024: $13M–$14M (low for dead cap window)
    - 2025: $45M–$50M
    - 2026: $50M–$54M
    - 2027: $53M–$54M
    - 2028: $53M–$54M (voidable or reworked)

**B. Fallback Scenarios (if negotiations stall):**

**1. Four-Year Structure**
   - 4 years, $210M–$218M ($52.5–$54M AAV), $170M–$175M guarantees, $125M–$130M at signing, incentives/vested performance escalators increased, player-friendly early opt-out and no-trade through entire term.

**2. Aggressive Market Reset Structure**
   - 5 years, $270M ($54M AAV), $200M guarantees, $150M at signing, most player-friendly guarantee, with four years fully protected for injury/skill/cap, and larger up-front cash flow. Consider only if Broncos refuse to meet guarantee thresholds or seek length/cap smoothing concessions.

**3. High Cash-Flow Shorter Deal**
   - 3 years, $160M ($53.33M AAV), $130M fully guaranteed. All money in first three years (aligned to “tag plus premium” value). Use only as agent of last resort if Broncos refuse 5-year term or guarantee window.

---

### II. Rationale for Major Provisions

**1. Five-Year Length:**  
- Most consistent with upper-tier QB deals (Burrow, Lawrence, Herbert, Hurts); maximizes guarantee “window,” aligns perfectly with cap surges through 2027–28.

**2. $53M–$54M AAV:**  
- Supported by comps, market inflation, player’s younger age, better durability, and strong advanced stats. Maintains top-5 AAV and sets floor for negotiation; protects against future market inflation.

**3. $185M–$200M Guarantees:**  
- Reflects market trend towards >70% of deal guaranteed, justified by elite performance, ironclad durability, no major injury risk, top-5 leadership reports, and versatile, coach-proof production.

**4. Significant Up-Front Cash:**  
- $55M–$60M signing bonus builds immediate family security and investment leverage, aligns with tax-advantaged take-home, supports off-field planning (critically protects against injury/early career end).

**5. Rolling/Trigger-Based Guarantees:**  
- Bases/option bonuses vest annually, forcing team to make decisions on player status early in league year; avoids “string along” and protects against restructure risk without commensurate security.

**6. Low 2024 Cap Number:**  
- $13M–$14M cap hit aligns with Broncos’ 2024 dead money challenges and frees front-office cash to extend Patrick Surtain II or make additional roster signings.

**7. Incentive Structure:**  
- Aligns upside with team success; playoff/accolade triggers reward excellence, not empty stats—preserves cap/flexibility for team if “down years” occur but maximizes player earning in peak years.

**8. Protective Clauses:**  
- No-trade and no-tag are crucial for control, family/location stability, and future market leverage. Player/control options in final year prevent being “trapped” as cap spikes again.

**9. Medical, Offseason, and Family Considerations:**  
- All recovery options funded/covered; workout bonuses flexible for family needs. Matches “Player as Franchise” status and ensures best-in-class care.

### III. Implementation Timeline

**A. Pre-Negotiation Phase (Immediately to Start of Training Camp)**
1. **Internal Team Alignment and Agent Prep:**  
   - Circulate this comprehensive package to player, agent, core advisors, and family.  
   - Secure player's buy-in to minimum/optimal condition line(s).
2. **Broncos Discussion:**  
   - Initiate formal negotiations with GM and cap team.  
   - Provide full written scenario matrix—primary, fallback, and aggressive options.

**B. Negotiation Phase (Pre-Season, Target: Start of Training Camp)**
1. **First Meeting:**  
   - Lead with Moderate/Primary Offer; communicate willingness to consider shorter term or escalated guarantee upon specific triggers.
2. **Follow-up:**  
   - Address pushback (if any) on guarantees by raising incentive upside and buffer years.  
   - If offers lag, pivot to “aggressive” scenario—player holds all major leverage as camp nears.
   - Use public and team sentiment factors as pressure points if necessary (“leadership window,” “locker room stability”).
3. **Deal Finalization:**  
   - All contract language reviewed with player’s legal/tax counsel and NFLPA.  
   - Confirm all protective/insurance and medical clauses.

**C. Post-Signing (Within 24–48 hours)**
1. **Internal Briefings:**  
   - Inform locker room, position coaches, and corporate sponsors privately prior to public release—maximize buy-in and stakeholder celebration.
2. **Official Team/League Announcement:**  
   - Coordinate a joint team-player press conference; include player, GM, head coach, and ownership.  
   - Release detailed but fan-friendly contract breakdown highlighting guarantees, team cap health, and competitive window.
3. **Community and Business Activation:**  
   - Launch jersey/merchandise campaigns; schedule media appearances for player as face of next “Broncos Era.”
   - Leverage social media for fan engagement—highlight player’s leadership, family involvement, and championship vision.

**D. Near-Term Calendar (First 4 Weeks Post-Signing)**
- Finalize Surtain II extension with leverage gained from locked-in cap certainty.
- Initiate family/offseason planning: trust funding, insurance allocation, housing/education planning per family advisor recommendations.

### IV. Communication Strategy

**A. Stakeholder Communication Priorities**

**1. Internal – Team/Coaches/Players:**  
   - Emphasize: "Leadership cornerstone and competitive stability secured.”  
   - Reinforce culture/continuity theme to optimize off-season prep and attract/retain veteran free agents.

**2. Ownership & Corporate Partners:**  
   - Frame as business and franchise stability move—ties directly to $170M+ in projected incremental value, locks in national TV/time slots, and enables new major partnerships.

**3. Media/Public:**  
   - Lead with: "Broncos secure elite QB, maximize championship window, reaffirm commitment to excellence, stability, and fan engagement.”  
   - Use media days, podcasts, and team content channels to reinforce player’s all-Pro play, community engagement, and vision for Denver.

**4. Player & Family:**  
   - All communication should reinforce guaranteed security, wealth preservation, career/health support, family stability, and forward-planning resources.
   - Immediate appointment with team and external financial/legal advisors to execute all trust, investment, and wealth-protection actions.

**5. NFLPA & Market:**  
   - Announce as market-aligned, player-value-protective contract; secures fair benchmark for next wave of quarterback deals but avoids unsustainable “market-reset” that could affect labor harmony.

---

### V. Stakeholder Concerns and Responses

**A. Player Family (Security, Flexibility):**  
   - Confirm contract meets $185M (minimum) guarantee threshold, robust life/injury protections, full family-oriented relocation and medical provisions.
   - Wealth planning in place—secure private school, college funds, housing paid in full, and legacy investment within 30 days.

**B. Team Ownership/Front Office (Cap/Risk):**  
   - Contract prevents 2024–25 “cap pinch,” aligns with peak cap flexibility, and avoids future dead-cap crisis by restraining void-year overuse.
   - Protection clauses permit team to escape post-Year 3/4 if performance or health decline—minimizes catastrophic risk; rolling vesting mechanisms for annual flexibility.

**C. Coaches/Roster/Locker Room:**  
   - "Dead money era” ends, assures cultural and schematic continuity.
   - Retention of star talent (WR, OL, Surtain) facilitated by long-term QB commitment, optimizing on-field synergy.

**D. Sponsors/Business Office:**  
   - Immediate activation plans: jersey/merch packages, community event scheduling, and new digital/social campaigns tied to “Face of Franchise” deal.

---

### VI. Final Negotiation Strategy

1. **Initial Presentation:**
    - Open with “Moderate” 5-year, $265M, $185M guarantee, $55M signing bonus structure—backed by full statistical and market comp report, injury/durability log, and leadership/locker room testimony.
    - Articulate non-negotiable floor: $185M in guarantees, three years full skill/injury/cap protection, minimum $53M AAV, all standard player protections and family medical/relocation benefits.

2. **Leverage Points:**
    - Player’s statistical comparables (Goff, Lawrence, Hurts) all support position; stress the unique timing—Broncos' window, cap surge, reset from past dead money.
    - Alternative cost/risk for team is massive: higher financial and draft capital required for new QB, locker room and business collapse in event of player departure.

3. **Negotiation Pivots:**
    - If guarantees stall below $185M: escalate threat of short bridge/“tag and hold out” pathway; lean on family/leadership narrative ("winning window closes, lost competitive and community momentum").
    - If forced to consider “Conservative” (4-year) structure: require higher up-front guarantee ($135M–$140M at signing), increased per-year and playoff incentives, plus player opt-out after Year 2 or if team fails to guarantee 80% of money/honor triggers.
    - If market spikes again during negotiation (e.g., another major QB signs higher deal), be prepared to re-anchor ask using new AAV/guarantee threshold.

4. **Mutual Interest/Concessions:**
    - Acknowledge team’s cap challenges, allow maximum 2024–2025 flexibility via low opening cap hits.
    - Offer mutually beneficial press and community rollout, shared activation of player and team brands to build market and reputation.
    - Close with strong “partnership” message—player wants to bring Denver a championship, mentor future leaders, and be remembered as the franchise’s iconic QB.

### VIII. CONCLUSION

Your client, Marcus Williams, holds one of the strongest quarterback negotiation positions in recent NFL history: elite Top-8 play, unmatched durability, leadership, locker-room and business/cap synergy with the Broncos' competitive window. The contract structure recommended here:
  - Maximizes short- and long-term financial/family security,
  - Delivers market-standard or better compensation,
  - Safeguards against injury/performance risk,
  - Keeps Denver roster competitive and culturally strong for the duration of the championship pursuit.

The “Moderate” five-year, $265M deal with $185M practical guarantees, a top-end signing bonus, escalator upside, and comprehensive protections is both fair and opportunistic—taking advantage of team needs, market conditions, and the synergy between your client’s prime and the Broncos’ window.

If negotiations hit absolute impasse, agents are prepared to escalate to aggressive guarantee/shorter-term pathways, or leverage tag/free agency in a robust market. At NO POINT should negotiations accept below-comparable guarantees, reduced injury protection, or lack of family/medical/mobility safeguards.

**Implementation plan is designed for transparent, enthusiastic buy-in from player, family, Broncos leadership, coaches, teammates, fans, media, and business partners.**  
**Communication will focus on this being an "era-defining," "championship-building" move that secures both the franchise’s future and the player’s family legacy.**

**Let’s close this contract, execute the window, and solidify both your client’s and the Broncos’ status atop the modern NFL.**
